// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers

	ADDNUM(X,Y)
		Print "Please Enter a Number"
			Set X = user input
		Print "Please Enter another Number"
			Set Y = user input	//Ask for numbers
		
		Perform X + Y			//Add the numbers
			Set X + Y = Z
			
			Print "The cumulative value of your numbers is"
			Return (Z)		//Print value


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

	EVENODD(X)
		Print "Please Enter a Number"
			Set X = input 		//Ask for number

			if (X % 2 == 0)
				Print X "is an even number"
				
			else(
				Print X "is an odd number") //Print result



// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

	CALC(A,B,C,D,E,MIN,MAX)
		i == 0
		For i < 5 Print "Please enter a number:"
			Store input in A, B, C, D, E successively
				i++		//Get user input
		
		Perform A+B+C+D+E == F
		Perform F / 5 == G
			Print "The average is" G	//Print result and description

		MIN == (maximum number allowed for INT)
			Loop A through E as svalue
			if svalue < MIN, MIN == svalue;
				Print "The minimum is" svalue	//Print result and description

		MAX == (minimum number allowed for INT)
			Loop A through E as lvalue
			if lvalue < MAX, MAX == lvalue;
				Print "The maximum is" lvalue	//Print result and description
